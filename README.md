# Days-of-code

A huge step to deliberately write some Python codes for my upskilling

## 1st day of Code

This was more like a refresher for Python with the print statement. I utilized the Replit platform for my first day of code.

## 2nd day of code

For my second day of Code, I wrote algorithms for 2 problems - Solving two sums and converting Roman numerals to integers. 
For the two-sum problem, I wrote a function that looks in an array of integers called nums and checks for two integers that sum up to an integer called target. It returns the indices of the two integers in nums that sum up to the target, in a list.
For the second problem, I wrote codes to convert Roman numerals to integers, noting that some Roman numerals are written largest to smallest from left to right, and in other instances, they are subtracted like IV and IX

## 3rd day of code

I solved the problem of converting integers to its corresponding Roman numerals. It defines a class Solution with a method intToRoman, which takes an integer num as input and returns its Roman numeral representation as a string. The algorithm utilizes a dictionary integer_values to map integer values to their respective Roman numeral symbols. I iterated through the dictionary, repeating each Roman numeral symbol while its value fits into the input number (num). The algorithm decreases the input number by the corresponding value of the Roman numeral symbol as it constructs the Roman numeral representation.

## 4th day of code

I solved the problem of finding the index of a number in an array using the searchInsert method. The algorithm essentially performs a **binary search** to find the position of the target in a sorted array - nums or to determine the position where the target should be inserted. It has a time complexity of O(log n) since it divides the search range in half in each iteration of the loop.
